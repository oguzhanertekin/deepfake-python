## What is Deepfake? How does it operate?

Deepfake is a form of media in which a picture of one person is replaced with another using artificial neural
networks. The name "Deepfake" is derived from the underlying artificial intelligence (AI) technique known as "deep
learning." To create phony media that seems genuine, deep learning algorithms are utilized to swap faces in videos
and digital material. These algorithms train themselves to solve issues when given enormous amounts of data.

Although there are various ways to produce Deepfake media, the most popular one makes use of face-swapping
autoencoders in deep neural networks using autoencoders. To serve as the foundation for the Deepfake, a series of
video clips of the person you want to put in the target must come first, followed by a target video. The target video
may be a clip from a Hollywood film, for instance, while the films of the person you want to place in the movie could
be unrelated footage you acquired from YouTube.

A deep learning AI algorithm called the autoencoder is tasked with watching the video clips to learn how the
person appears from various perspectives and in various environments and then mapping that person onto the person
in the target video by identifying shared traits.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), another kind of machine learning, are incorporated into the process.
GANs identify and fix any Deepfake problems over the course of several rounds, making it more challenging for
Deepfake detectors to identify them.

In order to "learn" how to create fresh instances that closely resemble the actual thing, GANs are also
frequently utilized as a popular technique for the production of DeepFake.

## Advantages of Deepfake
● Deepfake may be utilized as a creative medium to revive historical figures. As an illustration, a painting of the
Mona Lisa may be utilized to create a computer-generated image of a talking Mona Lisa.
● AI avatars may be created using Deepfake technology and utilized in training videos. Since lockdowns and
health concerns have made video shootings with actual humans much more challenging to pull off, startups
like London-based Synthesia have been drawing greater attention from the business world amid the COVID
epidemic.
● In order to test clothing or new haircuts before trying them on in person, Deepfake may be utilized to build
individual avatars.
● Deepfake can also be used for identity protection and anonymization in various fields like investigative news
reporting, finance, etc.
Disadvantages of Deepfake
● With the use of modified celebrity videos, Deepfake may be utilized to distribute false information.
● Deepfake may also be used to launch deceptive social media campaigns that influence public opinion and
have unfavorable effects.
● Politicians have also employed Deepfake videos. For instance, a Belgian political party broadcast a video of
Donald Trump speaking and urging Belgium to leave the Paris climate accord in 2018. But the address was a
deep fake; Trump never gave it. Deepfake has previously been used to produce deceptive films, and
tech-savvy political gurus are preparing for a new wave of fake news that will incorporate this impressively
realistic Deepfake.

## Does Deepfake only consist of videos?
Deepfake isn’t merely found in videos. A rapidly expanding field with a vast array of uses is Deepfake audio.
With just a few hours (or, in some cases, minutes) of audio of the person whose voice is being cloned, a realistic
audio Deepfake can now be created using deep learning algorithms. Once a model of a voice is created, that person
can be made to say anything, as was the case last year when the fake audio of a CEO was used to commit fraud.

## How to recognize Deepfake?
As Deepfake spreads, society as a whole will likely need to acclimate to seeing Deepfake films in the same way
that internet users have grown skilled at spotting other types of fake news.
In order to identify and stop Deepfake technology from spreading, which might start a vicious cycle and perhaps do
more harm, it frequently takes more advanced Deepfake technology to be developed, as is the case with cybersecurity.
A few signs may be used to identify Deepfake:
● Videos where the person never blinks, blinks too frequently, or blinks in an unnatural way are the
consequence of the current deepfake's struggles to convincingly animate faces. But a fresh Deepfake that
didn't have this issue was issued when researchers from the University of Albany published a report
identifying the irregular blinking.
● Keep an eye out for facial issues, skin or hair issues, and faces that look blurrier than the surroundings in
which they are situated. the possible abnormally soft appearance of the focus.
● Is the lighting unnatural-looking? The lighting of the clips that served as models for the false video is
frequently kept by Deepfake algorithms, even when it is not a good match for the lighting in the target video.
● If the video was fabricated but the original audio was not carefully modified, the audio could not seem to fit
the person.
